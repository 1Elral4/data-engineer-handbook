# Homework

- Make two dashboards with Tableau public
  - an executive dashboard that illustrates different stuff than in the lab
  - an exploratory dashboard with filters
  - You can use the `match_details`, `matches`, `medals`, `medals_matches_players` datasets in `3-spark-fundamentals` instead if click stream data is too boring

Publish the dashboard to Tableau Public and attach a zip file with a text file containing the necessary links.

## Instructions on how to Publish a Tableau Dashboard to the Public

In order to make sure your dashboard is publicly accessible to anyone without requiring them to log into a Tableau account, please follow these steps:

-  Make sure your dashboards are "Public" by following these steps in your Tableau software:
-  Click on "File" in the menu.
-  Select "Public" and then "Save to Tableau Public Asâ€¦" if they are not already saved to Tableau Public.
-  Once the dashboards are saved to Tableau Public, you will receive a proper URL from Tableau Public that starts with "https://public.tableau.com/views/".
