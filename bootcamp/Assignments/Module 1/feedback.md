** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Thank you for your submission. Below, you will find feedback on each task and how well it aligns with the requirements.

### Task 1: DDL for `actors` Table
- The table schema is well-defined.
- You used custom types for `film_info` and `quality_class`, which effectively encapsulates multiple fields and categorization.
- The primary fields `actor_id` and `actor_name` are appropriately included.

**Improvements:**
- Consider adding PRIMARY KEY constraints on `actor_id` for uniqueness.

### Task 2: Cumulative Table Generation Query
- The logic of filling the `actors` table year by year using a loop is correctly implemented.
- You are effectively using common table expressions (CTEs) to handle year-over-year changes.

**Improvements:**
- Depending on the SQL environment, you may want to safeguard against infinite loops or unexpected behavior by adding additional error-checking within the loop.

### Task 3: DDL for `actors_history_scd` table
- You provided a clear and concise definition for the table structure needed for a type-2 dimension.
- Properly accounted for fields such as `startdate` and `endate` for historical tracking.

**Improvements:**
- Include primary keys or unique constraints if necessary.

### Task 4: Backfill Query for `actors_history_scd`
- The query does an excellent job using CTEs to track changes and generate streak identifiers.
- It appears to correctly backfill the `actors_history_scd` table reflecting change points.

**Improvements:**
- Consider implementing additional checks or comments in your SQL to ensure clarity.

### Task 5: Incremental Query for `actors_history_scd`
- You've written a comprehensive approach to handle the incremental updates with clear segments for changed, unchanged, and new records.
- CTEs help simplify the logic and make the code organized.

**Improvements:**
- Ensure all temporary table or type setups are appropriately documented or cleaned up if necessary.

### Final Comments
Overall, your submission meets the core requirements of the assignment with well-structured SQL code and logical approaches to the data modeling tasks. You have utilized advanced SQL features such as types, enums, loops, and CTEs effectively to achieve the required outputs.
