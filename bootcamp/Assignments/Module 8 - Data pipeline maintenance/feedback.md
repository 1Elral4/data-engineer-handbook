Dear Student,

Thank you for submitting your work on managing and maintaining pipelines for critical business metrics. Here's my feedback on your submission:

### Clarity and Detail:
- **Ownership Assignments:** The primary and secondary owners for each pipeline area are clearly listed. However, you've labeled secondary owners with multiple engineers in a slash-separated format (e.g., Eng2 / Eng3). It might be better to ensure distinct secondary ownership to avoid confusion or overlap. Also, it would make sense to assign specific roles, like finance for profit-related pipelines.
- **On-call Schedule:** The on-call schedule is laid out with an intent for fairness, avoiding consecutive weeks and considering holiday coverage. However, the description of considerations and rotations lacks explicit details on engineer transitions week by week, beyond the holiday seasons. It would be helpful to have a rotation example for regular weeks.
  
### Fairness and Feasibility:
- The holiday load balancing is different for each year, which is a good approach to ensure fairness over multiple years. However, detail on what happens during non-holiday periods or how transitions work between non-consecutive weeks is missing.

### Comprehensive Runbooks:
- The runbooks for investor-related pipelines need more detail. While you list some generic potential issues, each pipeline should have specific runbooks that outline:
  - Pipeline name and purpose.
  - Specific types of data processed within the pipeline.
  - SLAs for addressing the particular issues mentioned.
  - Clear steps on the on-call procedures when these issues occur.
- Currently, the common issues are noted in a somewhat generic sense, and while it's a good start, more specificity is needed to make them actionable.

### Markdown Formatting:
- The submission is well-structured in Markdown format, which aids readability. However, the inclusion of further detailed examples or explanations in each section can enhance clarity.

### Areas for Improvement:
- Assign unique secondary owners for clarity.
- Add specific rotation examples for weeks beyond holidays.
- Enrich runbooks with detailed, pipeline-specific information. Include SLAs, precise data types managed, and explicit on-call processes.
  
Overall, your submission demonstrates a solid understanding of the primary tasks, such as ownership and basic scheduling. Ensuring unique ownership and providing more detailed runbooks will elevate your work significantly.

**FINAL GRADE:**
```json

  "letter_grade": "B",

Keep up the good work, and consider these suggestions for stronger pipeline management and documentation in future tasks.
