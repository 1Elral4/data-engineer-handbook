** This feedback is auto-generated from an LLM **



Thank you for your submission. Here’s a detailed evaluation of your assignment:

### Task 1: Disable Broadcast Joins (Query 1)
- **Correctness**: You correctly disabled the default behavior of broadcast joins using `spark.conf.set("spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold", "-1")`. Well done.

### Task 2: Explicitly Broadcast Join (Query 2)
- **Correctness**: You used `broadcast()` correctly to join the `medals` and `maps` tables as required.
- **Efficiency**: Good use of broadcasting given the use case.

### Task 3: Bucket Join (Query 3)
- **Correctness**: Your process for creating bucketed tables is well implemented. You’ve correctly used DDL commands, repartitioned the data, and ensured that all tables are bucketed on the `match_id` with the specified 16 buckets.
- **Efficiency & Best Practices**: The SQL explanations commented out indicate an understanding of execution plans, verifying no shuffling occurs in the join, which is crucial for bucket joins.

### Task 4: Aggregations (Query 4)
- **Query 4a: Player with highest average kills**
  - **Correctness**: Query correctly identifies players with the average kills using proper grouping and ordering.
- **Query 4b: Most played playlist**
  - **Correctness**: You used a CTE to count playlist occurrences correctly. This can ensure accurate counts without duplicate record issues.
- **Query 4c: Most played map**
  - **Correctness**: Your use of joining with the `maps_df` DataFrame directly in SQL is efficient and correct.
- **Query 4d: Map with highest Killing Spree medals**
  - **Correctness**: The approach using a subquery to filter for "Killing Spree" and aggregating by maps is correct.

### Task 5: Optimize Data Size (Query 5)
- **Correctness**: You implemented `.sortWithinPartitions` appropriately and detailed the steps to check resulting table sizes.
- **Efficiency**: Your implementation and clearing of partitioned tables using different architectures show a good grasp of potential data size reductions.

### Additional Comments
- **Code Organization**: The code is well-structured with logical step progression and good use of functions to modularize tasks (e.g., your `descriptor` function).
- **Documentation**: Effective use of comments helps in navigating through the code and understanding each step, greatly adding to readability.
- **SQL & PySpark Usage**: You showcased effective SQL and PySpark skills, efficiently leveraging both to perform and optimize queries.

### Areas for Improvement
- One improvement could be ensuring that all strings, especially in `DDL`, follow a consistent style (use either triple quotes consistently for multiline strings).
- Consider checking for the presence of files or slight modifications in code that lead to unnecessary complexity (e.g., streamlining paths to data files).

Overall, your submission excels in correctly addressing the assignment's tasks with efficiency and clarity.

### FINAL GRADE:
```json
{
  "letter_grade": "A",
  "passes": true
}
```

Keep up the excellent work! Your understanding of PySpark and efficient handling of tasks are well demonstrated in this submission.
