Hello student,

Thank you for your submission on this week's homework assignment. I will provide feedback on each query task to help you understand your performance and areas where improvements can be made.

### Feedback

#### `query_1`: Tracking Players’ State Changes
- **Correctness**: The query correctly uses window functions to determine changes in player status over different seasons. The logic for determining "New," "Retired," "Continued Playing," "Returned from Retirement," and "Stayed Retired" is implemented accurately.
- **Clarity**: The query is clear and organized, making good use of comments for testing.
- **Suggestions**: Ensure the input data fulfills the assumptions made. Specifically, what columns like `years_since_last_active` assume about your data source’s completeness and accuracy.

#### `query_2`: Aggregations Using `GROUPING SETS`
- **Correctness**: The logic to roll up data at different levels (player, team, season) using `GROUPING SETS` is accurate. The query effectively handles the deduplication step and correctly deduplicates the data.
- **Clarity**: The separation into CTEs makes the query readable and logically structured.
- **Suggestions**: Verify data consistency in `game_details` to further shore against pulling incorrect counts. Consider including more detailed comments, especially in complex parts, to help understand the rationale behind specific aggregations.

#### `query_3`, `query_4`, `query_5`: Player/Team Insights using Subqueries from Aggregates
- **Correctness**: These tasks are effectively solved inside the `query_2` through strategic uses of the resulting dataset. The queries provide the correct answers by leveraging the CTE definitions.
- **Clarity**: Union-based method for combining insights is concise.
- **Suggestions**: Document the logic more extensively inside each union section for better clarity on the purpose of each query block.

#### `query_6`: Most Games Won in a 90-Game Stretch
- **Correctness**: The query correctly uses window functions to calculate rolling sums over 90 games and specifies a condition to filter valid results. It identifies the team achieving the most wins in any 90-game stretch.
- **Clarity**: Code is easy to follow with logical breakdowns.
- **Suggestions**: Provide a comment explaining the choice of a 90-game window, as well as the strategy for selecting game stretches. Ensure that all assumptions align well with the dataset structure.

#### `query_7`: Longest Streak of 10+ Points by LeBron James
- **Correctness**: The query utilizes the "islands and gaps" method effectively to count consecutive games. Your approach is well-adapted and yields valuable insights into scoring streaks.
- **Clarity**: The CTE separation elegantly clarifies the incremental steps necessary for defining the streaks.
- **Suggestions**: Expand on why certain RANK or DENSE_RANK functions were chosen, and the reasoning behind the completion of streak lengths as final output.

### Overall Evaluation
The submission demonstrates a robust understanding of SQL analytics concepts, specifically the use of `GROUPING SETS`, window functions, and tracking changes over time. Your submission successfully executes on all required tasks, with clear technical reasoning evident throughout.

### Final Grade
