Hello! Thank you for your submission on improving the YouTube experience through user journey analysis and experiment design. Let's go through your submission in detail:

### User Journey

Your recounting of the early days of YouTube provides a nostalgic and engaging backdrop to the platform's evolution. However, it would be beneficial to include more personal reflections on your journey with YouTube as a user. How did your experience change over time? Which features really stood out to you and made your engagement with the platform deeper or more satisfying? Adding specific examples of features you loved, such as the ease of finding content related to your interests or the community aspect through comments, would enrich your narrative.

### Experiment Design

You've proposed three experiments, each with clear objectives and logically structured allocations. Let's delve into each:

#### Experiment 1: Homepage Recommended Videos User Customization

- **Test Design:** You've logically split test cells into a control group and two treatment groups, with clear distinctions in the customization options provided. This is well-structured.
- **Metrics:** The leading and lagging metrics are appropriately chosen, covering both immediate and longer-term impacts. Your hypotheses regarding user engagement and satisfaction are clear and actionable.
  
#### Experiment 2: Ability to Generate Content Type Views

- **Test Design:** The test cell allocations are clearly delineated, providing a straightforward comparison between the standard homepage and the new customized view feature.
- **Metrics:** Leading and lagging metrics align well with the hypothesis, addressing user engagement, discovery, and satisfaction. Consider additional metrics that reflect changes in algorithmic recommendation accuracy post-experiment.

#### Experiment 3: Resize Video Player Width on Web

- **Test Design:** The allocation for control and treatment groups is clear and logical.
- **Metrics:** The proposed metrics effectively cover engagement and satisfaction, focusing on new ways users may interact with videos. Introducing metrics regarding user interaction with the expanded layout—such as multi-tasking behaviors—would provide further insights into this change's impact.
