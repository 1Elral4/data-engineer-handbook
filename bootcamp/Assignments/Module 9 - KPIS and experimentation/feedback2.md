**Feedback for Your Submission:**

**User Journey:**
Your user journey section is engaging and provides a clear narrative about how YouTube has evolved from its origin to become a sophisticated content platform today. You effectively highlight specific features and touchpoints that have created an exceptional experience for users, such as the recommendation engine and the progression from casual entertainment to a structured ecosystem. This section meets the expectations for providing a compelling story.

**Experiment Design:**

1. **Experiment 1: Home page recommended videos user customization**
   - **Test Design:** The test allocation (Control vs. two treatment groups) is well-structured, allowing comparison between different levels of user control over the homepage layout.
   - **Hypothesis:** Clearly stated with both null and alternative versions. This helps in making the expectations from the test explicit.
   - **Metrics:**
     - Leading metrics (e.g., time spent on home screen, CTR, etc.) and lagging metrics (e.g., total watch time per session, session length, etc.) are appropriately defined and align well with the hypothesis.
     - The metrics chosen provide meaningful insights for evaluating the experiment, although the expected impact on some leading metrics could be elaborated further.

2. **Experiment 2: Ability to generate content type views**
   - **Test Design:** Logical test allocation with control and treatment group. The concept of allowing users to create custom content views is innovative and draws an interesting parallel to Reddit's channel system.
   - **Hypothesis:** Clear and actionable, following the outlined template for null and alternative hypotheses.
   - **Metrics:**
     - Leading and lagging metrics are well-defined and aligned with the hypothesis.
     - Metrics like "topic view creation rate" and "diversity of content consumed" are particularly insightful in evaluating user engagement with the new feature.

3. **Experiment 3: Resize to any width the video window on web**
   - **Test Design:** The allocation of test cells is consistent, and providing the option for users to resize the video player is an idea that could cater to diverse user needs.
   - **Hypothesis:** Clearly articulated, focusing on user engagement and satisfaction.
   - **Metrics:**
     - Leading metrics such as "resize interaction rate" and time spent on video pages are relevant.
     - The identified lagging metrics support a comprehensive evaluation of the experiment's impact.

**Overall Impact:**
The experiments showcase a thorough understanding of YouTube's product experience. They are thoughtful and consider potential user benefits and drawbacks comprehensively, aligning well with YouTube's continued evolution. Each experiment is designed to enhance user engagement and satisfaction, highlighting your capability in experiment design.
